                    My name is Dien Nguyen. Growing up I had a huge fixation on computer and video games along with outdoor sports. I always had to either build computers or set up networks for family and friends. Strangely, I never took information and systems or computer science path in college—instead I went into economics. After a few years, I taught myself a bit of coding through tutorial and CodeAcademy website.
                    I stopped after while and focus on the job I had at the time. It took awhile, but I've finally decided to take a Coding Bootcamp at UCI Division of Continuing Education. So here I am—the path to become a Software Developer and hopefully make an impact in people's daily lives through technology.

                        Aside from all the work and school, I enjoy the outdoors with my dog Shiro whenever time allows it. On a day to day basis, I really enjoy time to myself with lots of gaming.
